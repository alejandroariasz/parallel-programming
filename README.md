implementations of blur effect using posix, openmp and cuda

This project contains several implementations of blur algorithm used to test performance in parallel programming, in order to see the functionality go to the folder of the technique of interest (cuda, openmp, posix) and check the readme files. 

The algorithm was tested using the images allocated in the img folder with resolutions of 720px, 1080px and 4k.
